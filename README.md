# WorldWise Travel App

## Description
A React-based single-page travel tracking app built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's React course. The app lets users mark cities on an interactive map, add notes, and view a list of visited locations. It features lazy loading with `React.lazy`, dynamic routing with `React Router`, and data persistence via a mock backend using JSON Server.
